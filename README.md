bucket-list
===========

A list (in no particular order) of things I'd like to achieve or experience before I die. This list is by no means exhaustive, and will be revised and added to over time. Pull requests considered, thoroughly, then most likely rejected.

## The List

- [ ] Circumnavigate the globe.
- [ ] Start a product based company.
- [ ] Live for at least a year with no home.
- [ ] Write a book.
- [ ] Learn some AI programing.
- [ ] Create a game that (at least some) people play.
- [ ] Record an album.
- [ ] Have kids.
- [ ] Skydive.
- [ ] Live in a remote cabin for at least a month.
